        "- The answer must directly and explicitly address all aspects of the user's question.\n"
        "- It must be grammatically correct, free of spelling errors, and use appropriate language without mixing languages.\n"
        "- The answer should be concise and avoid unnecessary information.\n"

        "- Be particularly critical of answers that are vague, incomplete, or contain linguistic errors.\n\n"
